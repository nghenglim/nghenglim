### PHP MVC Programmer

My main job at JobStreet is working as a programmer that use PHP MVC framework. To be more detail, it is developing using the Linux Apache Mysql with PHP MVC (model view controller) framework.

### What To expect From A LAMP Stack Programmer Using MVC Framework

To my surprise, some recruiter will still ask question like "do you know jquery/css/HTML". Nowadays when a programmer daily job is using PHP MVC framework, then the technology stack normally include Jquery, CSS, HTML, Mysql, Javascript and PHP.

### More Than Just PHP

PHP had already become as simple as English to me. As a person that likes challenges, I always thrilled to solve bigger challenges, that sometimes beyond what PHP can do.

For example I have written many python scripts to automate daily works. I have also worked with Solr and Elasticsearch in my daily job. There are a lot of things that I like to do and I cannot be limited into a specific scope - as I am a full stack software engineer.
