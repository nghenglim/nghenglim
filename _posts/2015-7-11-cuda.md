### What is CUDA
CUDAÂ® is a parallel computing platform and programming model invented by NVIDIA. It enables dramatic increases in 
computing performance by harnessing the power of the graphics processing unit.

### Installing CUDA with torch7
[how to install](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/howto_install_cuda_rpm_packages.txt)

```javascript
lspci | grep 'VGA\|NVIDIA'
uname -m && cat /etc/*release
wget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/rhel6/x86_64/cuda-repo-rhel6-7.0-28.x86_64.rpm
sudo rpm --install cuda-repo-rhel6-7.0-28.x86_64.rpm
sudo yum clean expire-cache
sudo yum install cuda

luarocks install cutorch
```

### Oops, something goes wrong
I forgot to search for web [whether my AMD graphic card can run CUDA](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12828268/cuda-on-amd-gpu-and-where-to-start-with-gpu-computing)

Lesson learned: do more research on graphic card before buying laptop. 

It seems like the best alternative I can have 
is to use opencl with cltorch. However the cltorch is still under development, so means that I cant utilise my GPU power
to run machine learning job with torch7. This is really unexpected for me.
