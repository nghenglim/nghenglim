This course is [From Nand to Tetris / Part I by Shimon Schocken, Noam Nisan](https://www.coursera.org/course/nand2tetris1)

### Course Summary

Build a modern computer system, starting from first principles. The course consists of six weekly hands-on projects that take you from constructing elementary
logic gates all the way to building a fully functioning general purpose computer. In the process, you will learn -- in the most direct and intimate way -- how
computers work, and how they are designed.

### Rating

I think this course is great for programmer with no electrical engineering background. After taking this course, now when I do coding, I can imagine the background
process done by the laptop -- logic gates, ALU, RAM, BUSES, machine language and the assembly language.

### Notes

- I did not do the assignment of this course, as it needs to install a software that chrome thinks that it is harmful.
- This course require no hardware to start, it uses a software program to simulate and to write a logic gate. From the logic gates we build a 16 bits pc.
  - Nowadays, we are building a computer from a computer.
- There are no part 2 yet, the book "From Nand to Tetris" should contain from assembly to tetris part.
