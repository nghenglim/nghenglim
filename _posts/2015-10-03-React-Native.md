- Its Javascript! Now every developer can easily take part in mobile development!

  - We all know hybrid or web view performance is not good, from a customer side of view, its always good to have a native app.

### Notice for Windows User
React native is best to develop with Mac or Linux, so if you are a Windows user that want to develop react native android, a VM is needed for less hustle.
