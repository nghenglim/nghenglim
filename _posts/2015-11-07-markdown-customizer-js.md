### Markdown Enhancer JS

Markdown Enhancer JS is a plugin to customize your markdown especially for static site generator such as Jekyll or Hugo. Main purpose to let the markdown support Github checkbox `- [ ]` or `- [x]` which is not officially supported.

### Repo

The repo is at [nghenglim/markdown-enhancer](https://github.com/nghenglim/markdown-enhancer). This is my first open source javascript plugin, hope can solve people problems well.
