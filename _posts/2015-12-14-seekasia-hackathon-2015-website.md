### Designing the website
It all begins from the day I play the role as seekasia hackathon committee. We have decided to create a single page application for our co-worker to view the latest information. After considering all the options, I have decided to put the website at [seekasia-hackathon-2015.github.io](http://seekasia-hackathon-2015.github.io), after review done we will then move the files to [seekasia website](http://www.seekasia.com/hackathon2015/).

### Benefit of hosting at github repo
FYI, the repo is at [github](https://github.com/seekasia-hackathon-2015/seekasia-hackathon-2015.github.io).

The good part of github is if you create a repo with {username}.github.io, the page will be seen at {username}.github.io within 5 minutes.

### The structure of the single page application
As the [initial committer](https://github.com/seekasia-hackathon-2015/seekasia-hackathon-2015.github.io/graphs/contributors), I will be in charge of structuring the single page application.

- Build with bootstrap
- I perfer [bootwatch paper](https://bootswatch.com/paper/), due to its appearance is following material design
- Using Github Flow - directly commit to master branch since is small application and contributors only me, Alfred, Aaron and Foo.

### So Far so Good
The Seekasia Hackathon 2015 had ended successfully, it has been a good memory among our committees for making the Hackathon held successfully.
