You can view back my previous related article about [atom first use review](http://nghenglim.github.io/atom-review/).

### Configuration needed to make Atom feel better
- Settings > show invisible (checked) : make whitespace show as Â·
- Plugins > tabs-to-spaces : convert leading  tabs to spaces or spaces to tabs
- Plugins > line-ending-converter : convert line endings(EOL) to Windows/Unix/Old Mac, and show current line ending in status bar

### Useful hotkey
The full hotkey list is at File > Settings > Keybindings, below are some nice feature which other IDE sometimes lack off but is useful

- ctrl + d : find and replace (while remain selection of previous found word)
- ctrl + / : toggle comment according to file extension, IMO the commenting style is way better than eclipse
- shift + tab : remove 1 tab in selected lines
- ctrl + shift + \ : reveal active file in tree view
- ctrl k + ctrl u : text upper case

### Useful shortcut
- right click + filename on pane >  Reveal in Tree View: show the file location in tree view
- right click + file in tree view > duplicate : duplicate the file and change to desired path
- right click + md file > markdown preview: preview markdown in atom
